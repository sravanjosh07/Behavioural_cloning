# Behavioural_cloning for self-driving-car
In this project, I worked on developing a model which mimics the manual driving by learning from the user driven car model and able to drive on a completely new testing track autonomously.

This project was implemented using Keras, Numpy, Cv2, GIT, Flask&Socketio.
